kava.ee is one of the most popular websites in Estonia, which offers an overview, which TV shows/series and when they can be seen. However, the searching options of that website hasn't worked for a while and there isn't really a nice option in which an user can make themselves a unique schedule (add to favourites or something). I will use web scraping to get the data of TV shows/series (past two weeks, considering that shows/series can be rewatched later) of three major sections (Estonian channels; channels of series; channels of sports) and implement a planner. The user can update the saved data and with the planner they can say, how much time they have and what shows/series they want to watch. Then the planner analyses data and proposes options, which the user can filter out step by step. Finally the user sees the best options they have, when to watch their favourite shows/series.
